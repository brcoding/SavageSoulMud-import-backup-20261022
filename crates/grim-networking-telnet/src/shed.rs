//! Global flood shed: the accept-rate gate for the listener.
//!
//! When accepts arrive faster than `max_connects_total` per
//! `total_window_secs`, the listener sheds (accept-and-immediately-close,
//! no handshake, no event) for `shed_secs`. All state is task-local to
//! the accept loop; nothing here crosses a copyover. Split out of
//! `server.rs` under the module line cap.
