# Deployment

Pushes to `main` that touch what runs on the box build a static binary in
GitHub Actions and roll it onto a single EC2 host (see the trigger gate below).
No Docker, and nothing is compiled on the box — a t2.micro (1 GB RAM) cannot
realistically build Bevy in release, so CI does it and ships the binary.

## Pipeline

**Trigger gate:** pushes to `main` deploy only when they touch what runs on the
box — `crates/**`, `data/areas/**`, `assets/**`, `deploy/**`, or the root
`Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock` / `rust-toolchain.toml` (see `on.push.paths` in
`deploy.yml`). Anything else (docs, `.planning/`, CI, scripts) skips the
pipeline; use `Run workflow` to force a deploy.
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

1. **build** — `cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`. The
   musl target produces a fully static binary. Most assets are `include_str!`-baked,
   but **area blueprints (`data/areas/*.json`) and social overrides
   (`data/socials/*.json`) are read from disk at runtime**, so they ship
   alongside the binary (see below). Uploaded as an artifact named `grim-binary`.
2. **deploy** — `scp`s the binary to `/opt/grim/bin/grim.new`, plus
   `deploy/deploy.sh`, `deploy/grim.service`, the committed `data/areas`
   folder (to `/opt/grim/bin/areas.staged`), and the committed `data/socials`
   folder (to `/opt/grim/bin/socials.staged`), then runs the script over SSH.

`deploy/deploy.sh` (on the host):

- **Swap `grim.new` into `grim` first.** On copyover the running process re-execs
  its own path, so that path must already hold the new binary.
- **Mirror the area blueprints** into `/opt/grim/data/areas`: the whole dir is
  wiped and repopulated from `areas.staged`, so an area removed or renamed in the
  repo doesn't linger. Only `data/areas` is touched — sibling `data/accounts` and
  `data/characters` (runtime player saves) are left alone. The server reads these
  at startup and re-reads on copyover, so they must be current before the roll.
- **Mirror the social overrides** into `/opt/grim/data/socials`: same
  wipe-and-repopulate shape as the area blueprints, so a removed social
  doesn't linger. The server loads them once at startup (they don't change
  while it's up), so they must be current before the roll; with no overrides
  on disk the built-in set applies.
- **Sync the systemd unit** from the uploaded `grim.service` (rendering `User=` to
  the deploy user); `daemon-reload` + `enable`. Track whether the unit *changed*.
- Then pick one:
  - server **down** → `systemctl start grim` (cold start).
  - server **up** but the **unit changed** → `systemctl restart grim` (one cold
    restart, so the running instance adopts the new unit — a copyover can't take
    effect until it does).
  - server **up** and unit **unchanged** → `kill -USR2 <MainPID>` — a **copyover**
    (hot restart). The process execs the new binary and hands its live listener +
    player sockets to the successor over a unix socket (SCM_RIGHTS); the successor
    reloads the world from disk and drops each player back into the room they were
    in, with **no disconnect and no re-login**. Signalling directly needs no
    privilege (the service runs as the deploy user).

### How copyover survives systemd

The unit is **`Type=notify`** with **`NotifyAccess=all`**. On startup the server
sends `READY=1`. During a copyover the successor also sends `MAINPID=<its pid>`
*before* the predecessor exits, so systemd follows the handoff instead of seeing
the old MainPID die and treating it as a crash. `Restart=on-failure` still means a
real crash (non-zero exit) restarts, while a clean admin/SIGTERM shutdown stays
down for a cold deploy.

Only **actively-playing** sessions (in-game, not linkdead) carry across; anyone at
the login prompt reconnects fresh. If a character can't be cleanly restored on the
far side, that one socket is dropped rather than logged into a bad state.

### Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM)

`systemctl stop` (and thus a manual stop) sends **`SIGTERM`**, which the server
traps to run a 30-second countdown, broadcasting warnings to every player, then
exits 0. `TimeoutStopSec=45` gives the countdown room before systemd would
`SIGKILL`. No login or credentials needed. (An admin can trigger the same
countdown in-game with `shutdown <seconds>`; see below.)

## One-time EC2 setup

On Amazon Linux the deploy connects as `ec2-user`, which already has passwordless
sudo, so it also runs the service — no separate service user needed.

**`deploy.sh` manages the systemd unit** (`deploy/grim.service`): it installs/updates
it on every deploy — rendering `User=` to the deploy user — and `daemon-reload`s +
cold-restarts once whenever the unit changes. So the box just needs the directory
and the user's sudo; the first deploy installs and starts the service:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/grim/bin /opt/grim/data
sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /opt/grim
```

The unit is **`Type=notify` + `NotifyAccess=all`** — this is what makes copyover
work. Under a stale `Type=simple` unit, a copyover looks like the main process
dying, so systemd stops the service (you'd see the in-game "restarting in 30s"
countdown); `deploy.sh` syncing the unit prevents that drift.

The service runs as the **deploy/SSH user**: `deploy.sh` rewrites the unit's
`User=` line to `$(id -un)` on install, so the `User=` value committed in
`deploy/grim.service` is just a placeholder — editing it has no effect. To run
under a dedicated service user instead, change how `deploy.sh` renders `User=`.

First-ever start fails until the first deploy lands the binary — expected. Don't
`systemctl start` by hand; let the deploy do it.

Also open **TCP 4000** inbound in the instance's security group.

## GitHub secrets

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `EC2_HOST` | Public hostname / IP of the box |
| `EC2_USER` | SSH user the deploy connects as (`ec2-user` on Amazon Linux) |
| `EC2_SSH_KEY` | Private key (PEM) for that user |

The binary itself reads no configuration — port `4000` is compiled in.

## Admin role (for the in-game `shutdown` / `reboot` / `copyover` commands)

The deploy does not need this — it uses `SIGUSR2` (copyover) / `SIGTERM`
(shutdown). But the in-game shutdown verbs are gated on an `admin` role.
Roles live on the character JSON
(`/opt/grim/data/characters/<name>.json`):

```json
{
  "id": "…",
  "name": "Deployer",
  "roles": ["admin"]
}
```

Granting is a manual JSON edit; a `data/` wipe drops it. A non-admin running
any of them gets the ordinary unknown-command response — the commands'
existence is not disclosed.

- `shutdown [seconds]` (default 30) — warned countdown, then a clean halt
  (stays down so a deploy can swap the binary).
- `reboot [seconds]` (default 30) — warned countdown, then a non-zero exit,
  so systemd (`Restart=on-failure`) restarts the server cold. Connections
  drop; the world reloads from disk.
- `copyover [seconds]` (default 30) — warned countdown, then the same
  in-place handoff a deploy `SIGUSR2` performs: players stay connected.
  One countdown runs at a time across all three verbs and `SIGTERM`.
  An in-game `copyover` is rejected while a countdown is active.
  A deploy `SIGUSR2` copyover ends any pending countdown when the successor
  process starts with fresh state.

## Caveats

- **Port `4000` is hardcoded** in `crates/example-mud/src/main.rs`.
- **Copyover reloads the world from scratch** — only persisted accounts/characters
  carry over, not transient world state. A character's room *is* persisted (written
  to disk on every move), so players resume where they were.
- **Copyover is Unix-only** (POSIX signals + fd passing). On other platforms a
  restart is a plain cold restart.
- **A crash (SIGKILL, panic) still loses** anything since the last disk write.
  Durable persistence (WAL + autosave) is planned; today the guarantees are
  save-on-disconnect, save-on-quit, and save-on-move.
