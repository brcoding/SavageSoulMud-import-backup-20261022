//! Crate dependency-direction / coupling guard.
//!
//! Encodes the internal crate dependency graph that `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3–§4
//! describe (the crate map + "Dependency direction" diagram) as an allow-list and
//! asserts **set-equality** against the graph `cargo metadata` reports today.
//!
//! The test fails on BOTH:
//!   * an **unexpected** edge — a new intra-workspace dependency nobody sanctioned;
//!   * a **stale** allow-list entry — an edge listed here that no longer exists.
//!
//! Either way the failure names the offending edge(s), so a coupling regression is
//! caught at `cargo test` rather than in review.
//!
//! Why a custom test and not `cargo-deny`: `cargo-deny`'s `bans` operate on crate
//! identities/features, not on "crate A may depend on crate B" intra-workspace
//! edges. Expressing a directed allow-list of workspace edges — and flagging stale
//! entries — is exactly what it cannot do cleanly, so we read `cargo metadata`
//! directly via the `cargo_metadata` crate.
//!
//! ── §4 vs. reality ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//! The ALLOWED list below is the source of truth for what the graph *is*. Where it
//! diverges from §4's table/diagram, the edge is still encoded (reality wins) with a
//! `// NOTE:` flagging the divergence for review. The headline divergences:
//!
//!  1. `grim-core` — the transitional "god-types" node (ARCHITECTURE.md §8).
//!     §4's table does not list it, yet most subsystems depend on it. Encoded here.
//!  2. `grim-scene`'s DEV-only harness edges to `grim-world` / `grim-channel`
//!     (`[dev-dependencies]`, ARCHITECTURE.md §10). Carved out as `dev` edges so a
//!     dev-only coupling can never masquerade as a normal one.
//!  3. §4's diagram routes `grim-world` / `grim-channel` through `grim-command`.
//!     Reality: they do not depend on `grim-command` at all (command dispatch is
//!     mediated by `grim-scene`); they depend on `grim-core` etc. instead.
//!  4. The facade `grim` and the `example-mud` binary are absent from §4's
//!     subsystem-direction diagram; both are encoded here.
