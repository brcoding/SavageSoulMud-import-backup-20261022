//! In-game input routing: the per-connection dispatcher that parses each line
//! for a session in [`ClientState::InGame`] into an in-game command.
//!
//! This is one half of the routing split — the pre-game half (login / creation
//! / character-select / MOTD) lives in the auth crate. This system handles ONLY
//! `InGame` clients; every pre-game state is skipped here.
//!
//! ## Intra-tick transition guard
//! A single pre-game line can advance a client to `InGame` in the same tick
//! (the MOTD ENTER, or a login-by-name reconnect). The pre-game (auth) system
//! runs first, consumes that line, and records the connection in
//! [`JustEnteredWorld`]. This system skips any connection in that set so the
//! triggering line is not re-dispatched as an in-game command. Ordering is
//! enforced by [`crate::SceneSystems::InGameInput`] (auth runs `.before` it).
