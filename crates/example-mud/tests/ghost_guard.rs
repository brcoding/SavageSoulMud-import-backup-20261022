//! Ghost-crate guard: no `path = …` dependency may point outside the workspace.
//!
//! Such a dependency compiles and ships, but `cargo clippy/test --workspace`
//! never selects the target — its tests never run, its lines never count.
//! (`members = ["crates/*"]` auto-includes in-workspace path deps, so only
//! outside ones escape. Membership itself and README presence ride on the
//! glob plus review, per the maintainer's call on #114.)
//!
//! Failure names the `from -> to (path)` edge. See issue #114 and
//! `.planning/tmp/issue-114-ghost-guard/DESIGN.md`.
//!
//! Why a custom test and not `cargo-deny`: same reason as
//! `dep_direction.rs` — `cargo-deny` cannot express intra-workspace edges.
//! This test reads `cargo metadata` directly via the `cargo_metadata` crate.
