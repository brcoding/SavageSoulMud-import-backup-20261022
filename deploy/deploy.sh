# Runs ON the EC2 host. Keeps the systemd unit in sync, swaps in the new binary,
# and rolls the server to it:
#
#   - unit changed → install it + one cold restart (the running instance must be
#                    under the new unit before a copyover can work).
#   - server UP    → **copyover** (SIGUSR2): the running process execs the new
#                    binary and hands over its live sockets; players stay
#                    connected. Nothing is stopped or restarted.
#   - server DOWN  → cold start.
#
# deploy.sh owning the unit is deliberate: a stale `Type=simple` unit makes a
# copyover look like the main process dying, so systemd stops the service (the
# in-game "restarting in 30s" countdown). Syncing the unit here stops that drift.
