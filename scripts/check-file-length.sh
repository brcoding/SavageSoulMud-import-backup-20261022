# Enforce module size caps (standard: .planning ticket 04/05, documented in
# AGENTS.md). clippy owns the per-function cap (`too_many_lines`); this script
# owns the per-file caps clippy has no lint for:
#
#   - production (non-test) code:      <= 400 lines per file
#   - shell files (lib.rs / mod.rs):   <=  80 lines  (doc + mod decls + re-exports)
#
# It ALSO enforces that shell files (lib.rs / mod.rs) contain **no definitions**
# — only module declarations and re-exports. Any `fn` / `struct` / `enum` /
# `trait` / `impl` / `union` / `type` / `const` / `static` / `macro_rules!` in a
# lib.rs or mod.rs is a violation (at any visibility — `pub`, `pub(crate)`, …):
# move it to a sibling concern module. Only the production region (before the
# first `#[cfg(test)]`) is scanned, so inline test modules are exempt.
#
# Test code is EXEMPT (tests are kept inline but split by concern; they do not
# count toward a file's size). A file's test code is:
#   - any file under a `tests/` directory (integration tests + harness), or
#   - a file named `tests.rs` (a split-out unit-test module), or
#   - every line from the first `#[cfg(test)]` onward in a production file.
#
# Production line count = lines before the first `#[cfg(test)]`, else the whole
# file. Exits non-zero (listing every violator) if any file is over its cap.
